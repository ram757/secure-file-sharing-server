# Secure Group-Based File Sharing Server

A Java-based application that was meant to add security to a Group-Based file sharing service

the start, but for learning purposes, the Group-Based File Sharing Service was built first and then 
new security features were added for each deliverable.  See the "phase" write ups in "/doc" folder.
